# UltimateTicTacToe
2 player Ultimate Tic Tac Toe made using C++

This was the project I made for my high school computer science class back in 2017. Originally worked with Turbo C++, so a bit older. Recently updated so it works with gcc compiler.

Future scope:
Create one player game with RL! (if I feel into it)
